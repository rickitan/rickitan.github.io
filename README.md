Leftronic UI Task
===========================

At Leftronic we work with a few technologies that are important on the
front-end: React, D3, ImmutableJS, and Gulp. In this vein, we want
candidates to use these to create a simple visualization to as a test.


Most of the setup has been done for you using gulp, React Router, React, and
webpack.

## INSTRUCTIONS

### STARTING THE APP

```bash
npm start
```

### THE GOAL

The goal if this task is to gauge the following:
1. How you work with new, and possibly unknown, technologies.
2. The completeness of the task.
3. Your ability to come up with solutions to use-cases as they arise.

*DON'T be afraid to reach out for clarification or help*

### TASK

We want you to create a "number" visualization that has the ability to track
changes given a number input.

So, if the number starts at 55, and goes to 60, or decreases to 25 the number
should have a display element that shows whether it has increased or decreased.

The requirements will be minimal:

1. Fork this repo and tag me (@chrisgeo) in an issue, or commit.
2. Create a 'Widget' (`widget.jsx`) that will render a resizable number
  a. The number must be rendered in SVG.
  b. The number must be animated with come into view.
  c. The number should have an indicator showing whether it has increased or decreased.
4. Styling is up to you, use your best judgement.
5. Put up a static page on github for us to view the result.
6. Show us your work! Ping me (@chrisgeo on github) or email: chris@leftronic.com when you're finished.

At the end of the task, we'll setup a time to go over your work and discuss the
solutions and your approach.
